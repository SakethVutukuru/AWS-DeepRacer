# AWS-DeepRacer
AWS DeepRacer is a machine learning competition that is organized by Amazon Web Services (AWS). It is a global racing league where developers and enthusiasts can design, train and race their autonomous AI models using the AWS DeepRacer console. The competition uses a physical, remote-controlled car called the AWS DeepRacer car, which participants can program to navigate a racetrack.

## Reinforcement learning
Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning that allows an AI system or agent to learn through trial and error by receiving feedback from its actions in the form of rewards or punishments. Unlike other machine learning algorithms, reinforcement learning can tackle complex problems where there is a long-term goal that needs to be achieved through exploration of various possibilities. Some of the benefits of reinforcement learning include its ability to develop an autonomous decision-making process and to learn from its mistakes.
# Use of reinforecment machine learning 
Reinforcement learning has many uses in building a model, particularly in situations where the outcome of the model is not immediately apparent. For example, in robotics, reinforcement learning can be used to develop models for machines to navigate through an environment autonomously by taking actions that maximize the reward function [2]. In addition, reinforcement learning can be used to improve recommendation systems by allowing the model to learn from the feedback it receives from users, thereby making better recommendations over time. It can also be used to optimize resource allocation, such as in inventory management or scheduling, by learning the best actions to take in different situations to maximize efficiency and minimize costs.
